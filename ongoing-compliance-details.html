          Our services encompass monitoring new legislations and regulatory changes, timely filings of annual returns, statutory forms, and all event-based notices with authorities such as the Registrar of Companies, Income Tax Department, and GST department. We prepare and submit required disclosures, certifications, and reports, and conduct health checks and reviews to ensure no compliance gaps exist.

          In addition to standard compliance routines, our professionals advise on complex matters including changes in directorship, share capital, buyback, related party transactions, and other special resolutions.
